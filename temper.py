What is YAML
YAML ain't markup language. YAML is a concise data serialization language, which
is typically considered easier to read than the more verbose JSON or XML. It is most often used in 
configuration files of servers and software applications. Clark Evans proposed the spec in 2001 as 
the result of an effort to simplify XML. According to his resume, 
at the time he conceived of YAML he was working with Python, which likely 
influenced the syntax of YAML as an indentation-based language.
